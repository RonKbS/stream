Meetup Streaming API Examples
-----------------------------

Please enjoy these examples of our

* [WebSockets RSVPs Stream](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/stream/2/rsvps/#websockets)

Clone this repository and run them locally in a [supporting browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets#Browsers_supporting_WebSocket). Or, since this gh-pages branch generally tracks the master branch, you can also see them here:

* [RSVPs Plotted on a `map`](http://meetup.github.com/stream/map/)
* [RSVPing members on a `photowall`](http://meetup.github.com/stream/photowall/)

We'd love for you to fork and add improments or entirely new visualizations.
